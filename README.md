# Static Code Analyzer

**A rule-based static code analyzer with PeopleCode-specific features and an extensible plug-in architecture.**

## About

Although it was written with PeopleCode validation in mind, it should be noted that it is in fact a configurable code analysis engine that can be used to evaluate any text-based file and produce reports based on its findings.

## Installation

To install the Static Code Analyzer, run the following:

```bash
pip install pscodeanalyzer
```

## Usage

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/lbaca/PSCodeAnalyzer/wiki) for details about the design, architecture, and configuration of the Static Code Analyzer, as well as instructions on how to invoke it and extend it with custom plug-ins.

## Acknowledgements

The Static Code Analyzer was written as part of the deliverables for my Master of Science dissertation at the University of Liverpool, titled "A Framework for Customizing ERP Systems to Increase Software Reuse and Reduce Rework When Challenged with Evolving Requirements." I mention this primarily in gratitude to my employer, who graciously waived their claim to intellectual property on my work as part of this academic pursuit.
